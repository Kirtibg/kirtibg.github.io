## Hello!
<!-- Welcome! -->

I’m Kirti, a Research Associate at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), advised by [Prof. Danish Pruthi](https://danishpruthi.com).
My research centers on advancing responsible and socially grounded language technologies, with a focus on how they serve people across diverse geo-cultural backgrounds. More broadly, my interests include:
1) Understanding how people interact with large language models through mixed-method investigations that capture real-world expectations, usage patterns, and societal impact and 
2) Developing geo-culturally aware evaluation frameworks to assess fairness, inclusivity, and accuracy in language technologies.


Before joining IISc, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I was part of the Fire OS Framework team for [Amazon’s Fire tablets](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Tablet-Family/b?ie=UTF8&node=6669703011). Prior to that, I was a Data Scientist at [Bajaj Finserv Health](https://www.bajajfinservhealth.in/), where I designed and built large-scale data pipelines to support data-driven healthcare applications.

You can find more details in my [CV]({{ site.cv_link }}).
