## About Me

I am a Research Associate at the [Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), where I work with [Prof. Danish Pruthi](https://danishpruthi.com) on NLP and Responsible AI. I am broadly interested in developing inclusive and socially aware language technologies that can serve people across diverse geo-cultural backgrounds.
Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I was part of the Fire OS Framework team for Amazon's Fire tablets.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning:** socially aware AI systems, geo-cultural diversity in NLP
